# FinalProjectSummons
This is code from my first ever CS final. This is a Java program that I'm planning on improving later on. If Game Freak sees this, this code is not for sale and if anything, I want to work for you guys in the future. That is all. By the way, if any of the TAs or the Prof is seeing this, I'm one of the teammates. This ISN'T COPIED. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS ON GITHUB.
